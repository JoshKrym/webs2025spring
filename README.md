# Introduction
For my project, I attempted to build a management website that allows you to monitor all of the computers on a network at a given time. At this point in time it is incomplete. But ideally it would allow a user to add a computer to a database of devices on a network, then the user would install an application on the computer, that this website would then repeatedly monitor, and update the contents of this website with depending on the results of the monitoring. This would allow you to see if a computer was running, get statistics from the computer, and also monitor what applications on the computer are up and running as well.

# Project 3: Website Portfolio

Your task in this unit is to **build a multi-page website using basic html and css files** — as opposed to a site manager like WordPress or Wix — **along with any media assets you wish to embed.** (Any JavaScript or animation you want to add for interactivity is welcome, but above and beyond expectations.) In assigning this, I have two main goals for you:

1. to learn how to manage a composite project made up of multiple interlinking files, and
2. to explore the affordances of the web design stack as a medium, and especially its ability to _flexibly render content for multiple audiences or reading priorities_.

As with the earlier projects, the selection of content is your choice. One relatively straightforward option for this unit is to stage and present the materials you produced earlier in the term! Depending on your needs and interests, however, you can also develop this into a more sustainable and public-facing platform from which to manage your online identities, or a mock-up of demo content you can use to show off your web-design skills. Whatever you choose, you should _consider your audience(s) and how they might land on your website, and where you therefore wish to direct their attention and next steps._

As you start planning your composition, consider: What have you been working on, in or out of this class, that you'd like to show the world? What have you made, or done, or pursued? If someone were to search for you without using your name, what terms would they use in the search? What images would represent or resonate with your answers so far? Or: if the site won't focus on _you_, what group, or thing, or event would you prefer to represent, and in how many ways could you tag or subdivide _that_?

See if any terms or images come to mind when you think of your subject, then work back and forth from image to word and back.
nd if your parachute is malfunctioning (i.e. you'd like even more specific direction), just let me know! I'm happy to talk things out in office hours.
